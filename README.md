# Weather API 
The idea of this project is to get the weather data live from this website: https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-query-builder/

We've created 3 functions:
- Random: GET a random pokemon on the list.
- Compare: Go to compare to pokemon. You gotta add them manually in the manner /compare?first=XXX&second=XXX
- Read: Read the information of a particular pokemon and returns it. 

I have also created 2 ways to visualize the retrieved informations:
- A html webpage with a random button
- A streamlit app with a random button 
It takes a bit of time at the moment to get the results.


Improvements points:
- Improve speed of results
- Create a nicer interface
- Add more complex calculations in the model ?
